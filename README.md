============

Sort and Store. This is a very small database with a small webinterface and a REST-API, built with django. It is used to keep track of the enormous amounts of electronical parts, that the c-lab aquired. We want to give Users the ability to search through a database of boxes for the part they require, instead of manually searching through countless boxes.
